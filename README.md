### Contributing:
This is a community project, so anyone is welcome to contribute. 

That being said, the main code base is soon to go through a major re-write.

A great way to help out is by adding preset tutorial messages to the ```tutorials/``` directory. These messages should be formatted just as you would format a discord message and they should be named ```<subject>.txt``` (all lower case).
