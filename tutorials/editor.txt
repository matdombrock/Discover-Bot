To get stared with coding you will need a good text editor. While it is possible to use just a regular editor like NotePad, you will be missing out on some really helpful features like line numbering and "syntax highlighting"

Here is an example of what we mean by "syntax highlighting":

You can see that the text is not just black and white, but colored instead. These colors will help you read the and debug your code a lot faster.

A good text editor to get started with is Sublime Text:

A great open source alternative to Sublime called Lime Text:

Some people also like NotePad++ which is also open source:

Pick whichever one sounds the best to you and get coding!
