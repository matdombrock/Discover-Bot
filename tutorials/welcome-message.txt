The goal of this discord server is to create a place where people can come together and discuss programming and computing in general in a safe and welcoming environment. While *the focus of this discord is to help beginners*, programmers of all experience levels are welcome here as long as you have a willingness to learn, and the patience to teach. 

**FAQS**
*Why is X language missing from the channel list?*
```
Right now there are no "helpers" who are familiar enough with that language to feel comfortable offering help or advice. If you think you could fill this role please contact an @admin or @helper. 
```
*Why is no one helping me?*
```
Either no one is here right now or no one knows how to help you. Wait a while or try asking in #beginner-questions.
```
*Why can't I post anything?*
```
This channel is locked. Head over to #introductions and say hi!
```
*Why is there no one here?*
```
This is a new server :)
```
*Can I become a helper?*
```
YES! Head over to #helper-applications and let us know how you want to help!
